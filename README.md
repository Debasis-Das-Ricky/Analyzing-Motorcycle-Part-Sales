# Analyzing-Motorcycle-Part-Sales
This project analyzes wholesale sales data for a motorcycle parts company operating three warehouses across the region. Using SQL queries on the sales database table, the project calculates net revenue for each product line while accounting for payment-related fees and filtering exclusively for wholesale transactions. The company sells five distinct product categories—Engine, Frame & body, Suspension & traction, Electrical system, and Braking system—through retail and wholesale channels across North, Central, and West warehouses. The analysis breaks down net revenue (total revenue minus payment fees) by product line, month, and warehouse location for the June-August 2021 period, providing business intelligence to support strategic decision-making and revenue optimization across the wholesale channel. This enables the board of directors to understand seasonal trends, identify high-performing product lines and warehouse locations, and optimize inventory and resource allocation strategies.
